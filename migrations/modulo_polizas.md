We are going to develop the policy module. At the UI level this should be similar to the clients module with its visualization and search features as a primary screen and a section to add the new policies.
For now lets make some mockup data on a temporal file and use them to display an example of policies visualization, also make the base UI that shows the policy base info: policy ID E: "CASF-234568", product type E: "Auto", client name E: "John Doe", client ID E: "12345678", list of monthly payments with the amount and date of payment and a checked icon if it was paid or not.
